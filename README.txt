GautrainNews
============

This is a simple Android application that aims to do the following:

- provide Twitter feedback on latest Gautrain news
- provide useful train timetable information based on the geo-location of the phone
(a) if I am near Sandton station it will immediately show all trains departing or arriving shortly
(b) using geo-location it can estimate which of these I were to be able to catch of I ran now!
(c) it can show other users of the app where we all are in respect with each other whiles in proximity of the train/stations.
(d) if two users are within 10m of each other it will play the same random song clip - Bleet&Greet function
